# chapter embedding

This mini project was a result of my own curiosity. I wanted the youtube timestamps features available for oflline
videos also but when you download videos from youtube they won't come pre-embeded.

So, i decided to do this.

If any issue occurs, i am more than happy to help you. ![Join](https://t.me/Chapters_embedding_public_group) this telegram group for any kind of reporting or support.
